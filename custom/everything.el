;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Everything is a very fast and lightweight desktop search-engine
;;   for MS Windows for finding files scattered around your hard discs
;;   (see http://www.voidtools.com).
;;   The package everything.el provides a simple interface to access
;;   Everything's search power via its ftp interface within Emacs.
;;
;;   Everything.el can also integrate itself into find-file-at-point
;;   aka ffap. So, whenever all other methods of ffap fail, let everything
;;   try finding the file at point. Best used in combination with
;;   the exquisite Icicles package.
;;
;;   Everything.el supports the following search patterns:
;;
;;   + wildcards:
;;     * ?
;;
;;   + boolean operators (besides the default 'and'):
;;     | 'or'
;;     ! 'not'
;;
;;   + case matching
;;
;;   + whole words matching
;;
;;   + full path matching
;;     via \ in your query
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;   Features that are required: `cl'.
;;   Features that are recommended: `ffap', `icicles'.
;;
;;
;;   Basic steps to setup:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/everything.el")
;;    (setq everything-ffap-integration nil) ;; to disable ffap integration
;;    (require 'everything)
;;
;;   Alternatively use the package archive at http://marmalade-repo.org
;;   and find everything.el via M-x list-packages.
;;
;;   ... and finally dont forget to start Everthings
;;       fpt server via Tools->Start ETP/FTP Server!

;;   Interesting variables:
;;
;;    `everything-host'             defaults to 127.0.0.1
;;    `everything-port'             defaults to 21
;;    `everything-user'             defaults to anonymous
;;    `everything-pass'             defaults to nil
;;    `everything-query-limit'      defaults to #xffffffff for the maximum number of returned filenames
;;    `everything-ffap-integration' flag to integrate everything into ffap, defaults to t
;;
;;
;;   Interactive commands are:
;;
;;    M-x everything
;;
;;        Prompts for a query and let you choose
;;        one of the files returned by Everything and opens it.
;;
;;    M-x everything-toggle-case
;;
;;        Toggle case-(in)sensitive matching.
;;
;;    M-x everything-toggle-wholeword
;;
;;        Toggle matching whole words.
;;
;;    M-x everything-toggle-path
;;
;;        Toggle including the path.
;;

;;
;;  Todo:
;;  + support changing matching-options (toggle-xyz) via shortcuts while typing
;;    the query in the minibuffer
;;  + support limiting the search to a specific sub-directory (and/or sub-directories?)
;;    while typing the query
;;  + integrate icicle-define-command to be able to use icicles action subsystem
